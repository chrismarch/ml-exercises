    "The CART algorithm stops if it cannot reduce impurity. So, if it is measuring the sum of the impurity of the children, weighted by the number of instances associated with the node, it might allow a node to have higher unweighted impurity. However, if it stops if any child node is not more pure than the parent (unweighted), then the children are guaranteed to be more pure.\n",
