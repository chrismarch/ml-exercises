    "1. _The classic Olivetti faces dataset contains 400 grayscale 64 × 64–pixel images of faces. Each image is flattened to a 1D vector of size 4,096. 40 different people were photographed (10 times each), and the usual task is to train a model that can predict which person is represented in each picture. Load the dataset using the sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces() function, then split it into a training set, a validation set, and a test set (note that the dataset is already scaled between 0 and 1). Since the dataset is quite small, you probably want to use stratified sampling to ensure that there are the same number of images per person in each set. Next, cluster the images using K-Means, and ensure that you have a good number of clusters (using one of the techniques discussed in this chapter). Visualize the clusters: do you see similar faces in each cluster?_"

To speed up the algorithm, you should probably reduce the dataset’s dimensionality (e.g., use PCA, preserving 99% of the variance). Use the model to generate some new faces (using the sample() method), and visualize them (if you used PCA, you will need to use its inverse_transform() method).
